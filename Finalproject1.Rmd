This data is from " https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/trump-approval-ratings "
Question :- how is the approval percentage growth for every pollster and since first poll?

```{r}
J <- read.csv('approval_polllist.csv')
  print(J)
  

J$EarlyDate <- J[1,4]
J

J$EarlyDate <- as.Date(J$EarlyDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
J$startdate <- as.Date(J$startdate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
J

J$daysSinceFirstPoll = difftime(J[[4]], J[[23]], units = "days")
J

J$total <- J$approve + J$disapprove
J

J$approvalPercentage <- J$approve / J$total
J

```
